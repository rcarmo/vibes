# Python UI parity implementation

## Agreed scope

Target the Python branch. Preserve Piclaw markup as closely as possible: DOM,
classes, icons, controls, and accessibility attributes. Adapt server wiring, not
UI design. Chat pop-out is explicitly excluded; terminal pop-out is required.
Commit tested slices incrementally. Do not change the Go worktree.

## Implementation order and acceptance criteria

1. Terminal service and UI: default-off Python PTY with Piclaw-compatible HTTP
   session/handoff and WebSocket input/output/resize. Ownership checks, expiring
   single-use handoffs, bounded output replay, reconnect grace, resize, child
   cleanup, and pane/pop-out transfer must be tested. Moving the terminal must
   preserve the shell; closing/expiry must not leak processes. Match Piclaw DOM.
2. Agent references: ACP-accessible MCP messages search/get with bounded output,
   session access scope, and reference resolution. Workspace references must have
   a tested file-access contract. Do not imply that an ID alone supplies content.
3. Composer: arbitrary files and clipboard images/files, error handling and
   reference pills; explicit Enter/steer behavior, atomic queued promotion,
   reordering and structured attachment/reference queue previews.
4. Sessions: persistence/addressing before switcher and mentions. Isolate composer
   history/state by session; switch/create/rename/delete with keyboard navigation.
5. Search, model and status: search scope; per-session model selection, catalog
   refresh/loading/error states; thinking capability gates. Refresh model,
   provider, thinking, execution state, context usage and compaction information
   together when switching sessions. Unknown metrics remain unavailable, not zero.
6. Verification: backend tests, frontend lint/build, headed Chromium/WebKit under
   Xvfb, desktop/mobile screenshots and DOM comparisons. Document deviations and
   unsupported ACP capabilities. No disabled tests to manufacture parity.

## Refinement decisions already supplied

- Piclaw is the behavioral and markup reference, not the Go terminal prototype.
- Terminal transport confirmed from Piclaw source: GET /terminal/session,
  POST /terminal/handoff, WebSocket /terminal/ws.
- No new framework or database replacement is planned.
- Security remains local-first: terminal must be explicitly enabled; origin
  checks and session ownership are required and are not a substitute for remote
  authentication. Remote deployment still requires external authentication.
- Backend-specific capabilities must not be fabricated for visual similarity.

## Evidence and deviations

Baseline: Python audit merged at ad06c10, capture tooling at 1a9f0cf. Prior audit
reports 390 Python tests and 38 headed browser tests. Re-run before relying on
these counts for the changed tree. Implementation evidence belongs below as each
slice lands. This document is a plan, not a completion claim.
