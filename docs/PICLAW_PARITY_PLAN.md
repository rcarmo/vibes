# Python UI parity implementation

## Agreed scope

Target the Python branch. Preserve Piclaw markup as closely as possible: DOM,
classes, icons, controls, and accessibility attributes. Adapt server wiring, not
UI design. Chat pop-out is explicitly excluded; terminal pop-out is required.
Commit tested slices incrementally. Do not change the Go worktree.

## Implementation order and acceptance criteria

1. Terminal service and UI: default-off Python PTY with Piclaw-compatible HTTP
   session/handoff and WebSocket input/output/resize. Ownership checks, expiring
   single-use handoffs, bounded output replay, reconnect grace, resize, child
   cleanup, and pane/pop-out transfer must be tested. Moving the terminal must
   preserve the shell; closing/expiry must not leak processes. Match Piclaw DOM.
2. Agent references: ACP-accessible MCP messages search/get with bounded output,
   session access scope, and reference resolution. Workspace references must have
   a tested file-access contract. Do not imply that an ID alone supplies content.
3. Composer: arbitrary files and clipboard images/files, error handling and
   reference pills; explicit Enter/steer behavior, atomic queued promotion,
   reordering and structured attachment/reference queue previews.
4. Sessions: persistence/addressing before switcher and mentions. Isolate composer
   history/state by session; switch/create/rename/delete with keyboard navigation.
5. Search, model and status: search scope; per-session model selection, catalog
   refresh/loading/error states; thinking capability gates. Refresh model,
   provider, thinking, execution state, context usage and compaction information
   together when switching sessions. Unknown metrics remain unavailable, not zero.
6. Verification: backend tests, frontend lint/build, headed Chromium/WebKit under
   Xvfb, desktop/mobile screenshots and DOM comparisons. Document deviations and
   unsupported ACP capabilities. No disabled tests to manufacture parity.

## Refinement decisions already supplied

- Piclaw is the behavioral and markup reference, not the Go terminal prototype.
- Terminal transport confirmed from Piclaw source: GET /terminal/session,
  POST /terminal/handoff, WebSocket /terminal/ws.
- No new framework or database replacement is planned.
- Security remains local-first: terminal must be explicitly enabled; origin
  checks and session ownership are required and are not a substitute for remote
  authentication. Remote deployment still requires external authentication.
- Backend-specific capabilities must not be fabricated for visual similarity.

## Evidence and deviations

Baseline: Python audit merged at ad06c10, capture tooling at 1a9f0cf. Prior audit
reports 390 Python tests and 38 headed browser tests. Re-run before relying on
these counts for the changed tree. Implementation evidence belongs below as each
slice lands. This document is a plan, not a completion claim.

### Terminal transport slice

Python now registers the session/handoff/WebSocket endpoints, disabled unless
`VIBES_ENABLE_TERMINAL=1`. It uses an HttpOnly SameSite=Strict owner cookie (a
Python-specific adapter detail), mandatory same-origin WebSocket/POST requests,
single-use expiring handoff tokens, 15-second reconnect grace, bounded output,
and cleanup on application shutdown. No terminal UI is wired yet. Do not enable
on an unauthenticated network listener. This is a local terminal, not a sandbox.

Verification: 397 Python tests pass, including real PTY I/O/resize, handoff reuse
rejection, expired handoff rejection, reconnect preserving the same shell,
disconnect expiry, disabled routes, invalid frames and origin rejection.
Outstanding: markup/UI port, controlling-terminal/job-control verification,
browser handoff flows, and comparison with Piclaw presentation.

### Reference correction — deployed 2.15.3 classic

The initial workspace Piclaw checkout was stale (4,479 commits behind upstream
at inspection). It is NOT the UI reference. Use classic app.bundle.js.map from
the installed Piclaw 2.15.3 release; extracted reference files are temporarily
under /workspace/tmp/piclaw-2.15.3-reference. Upstream main also confirms xterm.
Ghostty is an optional add-on, not the terminal renderer to port.

Reassessment adds folder references, upload progress, search attachment/image
filters, speech/push-to-talk, and grouped searchable session-picker lifecycle
metrics to acceptance scope. These are pending, not delivered capabilities.

The deployed terminal expects nested handoff.token, session_id/created_at/
process_pid metadata, ping frames, and explicit exit events. Corrected Python
transport accordingly. Cookie ownership remains a documented adapter difference;
the deployed client anonymous-token field is not trusted as authority here.
PTY launch now establishes a controlling terminal with TIOCSCTTY in an exec
helper (no threaded-server preexec_fn). Real tests cover foreground interruption
and shell survival. Backend suite: 399 passed. UI parity is not yet verified.
